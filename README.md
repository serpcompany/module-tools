# README

the 'tools' module is for small tools, like stuff you find on tinywow.com

## Process

1. make the typical django url/view/template for a single page
2. write the .js to accept the files and such via dropzone (prolly can reuse with includes)
3. if requires python to run, put that python code in the views.py file and reference it from the <form> element and / or .js code
