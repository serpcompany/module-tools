## Overview

The 'tools' module is for small tools, like stuff you find on tinywow.com.

Note: at first we are going to try and make as many of these as we can with utilizing all the processing on the CLIENT SIDE ONLY. Aka - try to make it run all in the persons browser so we dont need to use our server resources.

## Process (draft)

1. make the typical django url/view/template for a single page
2. write the .js to accept the files and such via dropzone (prolly can reuse with includes)

- [for the actual website project]: put the .js code in `tools/static/tools/js`
